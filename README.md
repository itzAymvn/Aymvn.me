# 👨‍💻 Aymvn.tech

[Aymvn.tech](https://aymvn.tech/) is my portfolio website, where I showcase the projects I have worked on and demonstrate my skills as a developer.

## 🚀 Technologies Used

The website was initially developed using pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, reflecting my foundation in front-end development. However, to enhance its functionality and provide a more seamless user experience, I decided to refactor the website using ReactJS. This allowed me to leverage the power of React's component-based architecture, making the website more modular and easier to maintain.

Continuing the evolution of the website, I further migrated it to NextJS, a popular framework built on top of React. This migration brought additional benefits, including server-side rendering, optimized performance, and improved SEO. With the integration of NextJS, I was able to introduce dynamic data and API routes, enabling more interactive and personalized features on the website.
